# capstone-project
*The capstone project, Fames, was my final project for the front-end development course at Nashville Software School. The project is a social and entertainment app. The app allows bands to manipulate the game assets to make it original and offer it to their fans locally.*

### Technologies I use
HTML5, CSS3, Sass, Javascript, AngularJS, Amazon S3, and Phaser

### The Game 
The game "Tank-U" was designed and built by [Lucas McDaniel](http://ldmcdaniel.com/#/). You can find the original [game here](http://ldmcdaniel.com/tank-u/) and the [repo here](https://github.com/ldmcdaniel/tank-u).
